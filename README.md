## The Story

**BigCam** was born from a real need. It started as a humble shell script written by **Rafael Ruscher** and **Barnabé di Kartola** so that Ruscher could use his Canon Rebel T3 as a webcam during his live streams about [BigLinux](https://www.biglinux.com.br/). That small hack proved so useful that it evolved — first into a more capable script, then into a full-blown GTK4/Adwaita application deeply integrated into the BigLinux ecosystem.

**Version 1.0** was a simple Bash script that bridged gPhoto2 with FFmpeg, streaming DSLR output to a virtual V4L2 device. It worked, but it was fragile — no error handling, no hotplug, no live preview.

**Version 2.0** was the complete rewrite in Python with GTK4 and Libadwaita. It brought a proper GUI with live preview, multi-backend camera support (V4L2, gPhoto2, libcamera, PipeWire, IP cameras), real-time OpenCV effects, virtual camera output, photo/video capture, and a modular architecture with separated business logic and UI.

**Version 3.0** (current) introduces the smartphone camera feature — turning any phone into a wireless webcam using only a web browser, no app installation required — alongside software-based camera controls (digital zoom, pan/tilt, sharpness, backlight compensation), an improved QR scanner with visual overlays, smarter smile detection with consecutive frame validation, complete internationalization coverage (29 languages), and dozens of refinements across the board.

We are grateful to Rafael and Barnabé for starting this journey.

## Why BigCam?

Most webcam tools on Linux are either too basic (just open the camera) or too complex (editing suites that happen to have a webcam input). BigCam fills the gap:

- **Zero cost, zero bloat**: Free, open source, no subscriptions, no telemetry. Runs natively on your desktop with GTK4 + Libadwaita.
- **Works with everything**: USB webcams, DSLR/mirrorless cameras (2,500+ models), Raspberry Pi cameras, IP/network cameras, PipeWire virtual cameras, and now **your smartphone** — all from one app.
- **Phone as webcam — for free**: No need to buy Camo, EpocCam, DroidCam, or iVCam. BigCam turns your Android or iPhone into a high-quality webcam using only the phone's built-in browser. No app to install, no account to create, just scan a QR code and start streaming.
- **Professional controls**: Full V4L2 control panel with software fallbacks for zoom, pan/tilt, sharpness, and backlight compensation — so every camera gets the same capabilities regardless of hardware support.
- **Real-time effects**: 16 OpenCV effects (filters, color grading, artistic styles) applied live to the preview and virtual camera output.
- **Virtual camera output**: Sends the processed feed to any video conferencing app (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, OBS, Discord) via v4l2loopback.

---

## Supported Cameras

BigCam detects and manages cameras through six independent backends. Multiple cameras can be connected simultaneously, and you can hot-swap between them without restarting the stream.

### USB Webcams (V4L2)

Virtually any USB webcam that exposes a V4L2 device works out of the box — Logitech, Microsoft LifeCam, Razer Kiyo, Trust, Creative, generic UVC cameras, and hundreds of others. Detected automatically via `v4l2-ctl`.

Supported resolutions depend on the camera: from 320×240 up to 4K (3840×2160) for high-end models. BigCam reads the camera's capabilities and presents only valid resolution/format combinations.

### DSLR / Mirrorless (gPhoto2)

Thanks to [libgphoto2](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/), BigCam supports **2,500+ camera models** from every major brand:

| Brand | Example Models |
|-------|----------------|
| **Canon EOS** | Rebel T3/T5/T6/T7/T8i, SL2/SL3, 80D/90D, R5/R6/R7/R8, M50, RP, 6D Mark II, 5D Mark IV, 1D X |
| **Nikon** | D3200, D3500, D5300, D5600, D7500, D750, D850, Z5, Z6/Z6II, Z7/Z7II, Zfc, Z30 |
| **Sony Alpha** | A6000, A6100, A6400, A6600, A7III/A7IV, A7R IV/V, A7S III, ZV-E10, ZV-1 |
| **Fujifilm** | X-T3, X-T4, X-T5, X-H2S, X-S10, GFX 50S/100S |
| **Panasonic** | GH5/GH5S/GH6, G9, S5/S5II, S1/S1R |
| **Olympus/OM** | E-M1 III, E-M5 III, OM-1, OM-5 |
| **Pentax** | K-1, K-3 III, KF |
| **Others** | GoPro (USB mode), Sigma, Leica, Hasselblad (PTP-compatible models) |

> Full list: [libgphoto2 supported cameras](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php)

When a gPhoto2 camera is detected, BigCam automatically stops GVFS from claiming it, establishes a persistent PTP/MTP session, and exposes all camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, image quality, drive mode, etc.) directly in the control panel.

### CSI / ISP (libcamera)

Cameras connected via CSI ribbon cable (Raspberry Pi Camera Module v1/v2/v3, HQ Camera, Arducam) or platform-integrated ISPs (Intel IPU6 on laptops). Detected via `cam --list`.

### PipeWire Virtual Cameras

Any PipeWire video source — OBS Studio virtual camera, screen capture pipelines, other apps streaming via the XDG camera portal. Detected via `pw-cli`.

### Network / IP Cameras

Any camera with an RTSP or HTTP video stream URL — security cameras, action cameras with WiFi streaming, IP webcams. Configure the URL manually in the app.

### Smartphone Camera (Phone as Webcam)

**The highlight of BigCam 3.0.** See the dedicated section below.

---

## Use Your Phone as a Webcam

BigCam turns any smartphone (Android or iPhone) into a wireless webcam. Unlike commercial solutions like DroidCam, Camo, or EpocCam, BigCam:

- **Does NOT require installing any app** on your phone
- **Does NOT require creating an account** or signing up for anything
- **Does NOT require a paid subscription** for HD quality
- **Works with any phone** that has a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Works over WiFi** — phone and computer just need to be on the same network

### How It Works

1. Click the **phone icon** in BigCam's header bar
2. BigCam starts a secure local HTTPS server on your machine
3. A **QR code** appears on screen — scan it with your phone's camera
4. Your phone opens a web page in its browser
5. Accept the camera permission and tap **Start**
6. Your phone's camera feed streams directly to BigCam in real-time

That's it. No drivers, no USB cables, no third-party apps.

### Technical Details

- **Protocol**: WebSocket Secure (WSS) over HTTPS with automatic HTTP POST fallback for browsers that reject self-signed certificates (Safari/iOS).
- **Transport**: JPEG frames encoded in the phone's browser via HTML5 Canvas + WebRTC `getUserMedia()` API, sent as binary WebSocket messages.
- **Security**: Self-signed TLS certificates generated on-demand, stored in `~/.cache/bigcam/`. Traffic is encrypted. Connection is LAN-only.
- **Latency**: Real-time, limited only by your WiFi network quality.

### Phone Camera Options

| Feature | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Camera** | Front (selfie) or Back (environment) — switchable mid-stream |
| **Resolution** | Auto, 480p, 720p (default), 1080p |
| **Quality** | Low (60%), Medium (75%, default), High (90%) JPEG compression |
| **Frame rate** | 15, 24, or 30 fps |
| **Orientation** | Automatic — detects portrait/landscape rotation |

### Connection Status

A colored dot next to the phone icon shows the current state:

| Color | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Gray | Server idle |
| Yellow | Waiting for phone connection |
| Green | Phone connected and streaming |
| Red | Phone disconnected |

## Features

### Live Preview & Streaming

- **High quality**: stream at your camera's native resolution (up to 4K) to Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, OBS Studio, Discord, or any app that reads a V4L2 device.
- **Low latency pipeline**: GStreamer with `pipewiresrc` for V4L2/PipeWire cameras, FFmpeg with MPEG-TS over localhost UDP for gPhoto2/IP cameras — optimized for minimal delay.
- **Multi-camera**: connect multiple cameras simultaneously and hot-swap between them with a single click. Each gPhoto2 camera keeps its own persistent PTP session.
- **Virtual camera output**: v4l2loopback integration exposes the active feed (with all effects applied) as a regular `/dev/video*` device visible to any video conferencing app.
- **USB hotplug**: cameras are automatically detected when plugged in or removed — no need to restart the app.

### Camera Controls

Full per-camera control panel with sliders, switches, and menus — automatically adapted to each camera's hardware capabilities. Controls are organized by category:

| Category | Controls |
|----------|----------|
| **Image** | Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Hue, Gamma, Sharpness, Backlight Compensation |
| **Exposure** | Auto/Manual Exposure, Exposure Time, Gain, ISO, Exposure Bias, Auto Priority |
| **Focus** | Auto/Manual Focus, Focus Distance, Digital Zoom, Pan, Tilt |
| **White Balance** | Auto/Manual, Color Temperature, WB Presets |
| **Capture** | Scene Mode, Image Stabilization, LED Mode, 3A Lock |
| **gPhoto2** | Aperture (f-stop), Shutter Speed, ISO, Image Quality, Drive Mode, Focus Mode, Metering Mode, and any other setting the camera exposes |

#### Software Fallback Controls

When the camera's V4L2 driver accepts a control value but PipeWire doesn't forward it to the hardware (a common issue), BigCam applies the effect via software using OpenCV:

| Control | Software Implementation |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Zoom** | Center crop + resize (1x to 4x) |
| **Pan** | Horizontal offset of the crop area |
| **Tilt** | Vertical offset of the crop area |
| **Sharpness** | Unsharp mask (Gaussian blur + weighted blend) |
| **Backlight Compensation** | CLAHE on LAB luminance channel (adaptive histogram equalization) |

Pan and tilt automatically apply a minimum 1.5x zoom when activated to create movement room. When zoom is increased manually, the pan/tilt range increases proportionally.

### Real-Time Effects (OpenCV)

16 effects organized in four categories, all combinable and adjustable in real-time with individual parameter sliders:

| Category | Effects | Parameters |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Adjustments** | Brightness/Contrast | Brightness (-100 to 100), Contrast (0.5 to 3.0) |
| | Gamma Correction | Gamma (0.1 to 3.0) |
| | CLAHE (Adaptive Contrast) | Clip Limit (1.0 to 8.0), Grid Size (2 to 16) |
| | Auto White Balance | — |
| **Filters** | Detail Enhance | Sigma S (0 to 200), Sigma R (0.0 to 1.0) |
| | Beauty / Soft Skin | Smoothing (1 to 25), Detail (0.0 to 1.0) |
| | Sharpen | Kernel Size (1 to 31), Strength (0.0 to 5.0) |
| | Denoise | Strength (1 to 30), Color Strength (1 to 30) |
| **Artistic** | Grayscale, Sepia, Negative | — |
| | Pencil Sketch | Sigma S (0 to 200), Sigma R (0.0 to 1.0) |
| | Painting / Stylization | Sigma S (0 to 200), Sigma R (0.0 to 1.0) |
| | Edge Detection | Low Threshold (0 to 200), High Threshold (0 to 400) |
| | Color Map | 21 palettes (Autumn, Bone, Jet, Winter, Rainbow, Ocean, Summer, Spring, Cool, HSV, Pink, Hot, Parula, Magma, Inferno, Plasma, Viridis, Cividis, Twilight, Twilight Shifted, Turbo) |
| | Vignette | Strength (0.0 to 2.0), Radius (0.5 to 2.0) |

Effects are applied in the GStreamer buffer probe before the frame reaches both the preview and the virtual camera output, so the processed feed is what external apps (Zoom, OBS, etc.) see.

### Tools

- **QR Code Scanner**: real-time detection using OpenCV WeChatQRCode engine with visual feedback — detected QR codes are highlighted with a red bounding box and the surrounding area is darkened. Supports URL, WiFi credentials (auto connect), vCard contacts, calendar events, phone numbers, email addresses, SMS, geolocation, TOTP authentication, and plain text. Detected codes open a detailed dialog with contextual actions (open URL, copy text, connect to WiFi, export vCard, etc.).

- **Smile Capture**: automatic photo trigger on smile detection using Haar cascade classifiers. Uses a 3-consecutive-frame validation algorithm to eliminate false positives — the camera only fires when a genuine smile is consistently detected across multiple frames. Configurable detection sensitivity and cooldown between captures.

### Photo & Video

- **Photo capture**: single-click or timer-delayed capture. For gPhoto2 cameras, the photo is captured at the camera's native resolution (not the preview resolution) and automatically downloaded.
- **Video recording**: records directly from the GStreamer pipeline using x264 in ultrafast preset, saved as MKV container. Recording continues while the preview remains active.
- **Photo gallery**: browse captured images with lazy-loaded thumbnails. Delete photos directly from the gallery with confirmation dialog.
- **Video gallery**: browse and play recorded videos with the system's default player.
- **XDG-compliant paths**: photos and videos are saved to the system's configured Pictures and Videos directories (e.g., `~/Imagens/BigCam/` on Portuguese systems, `~/Pictures/BigCam/` on English systems) using `xdg-user-dir`.

### Interface

- **GTK4 + Libadwaita**: modern, native GNOME/KDE look-and-feel with full dark/light/system theme support. Uses Adw.NavigationView, Adw.PreferencesGroup, Adw.SwitchRow, Adw.ComboRow, Adw.ActionRow for a consistent Adwaita experience.
- **Paned layout**: resizable live preview + sidebar with tabbed pages (Controls, Effects, Tools, Settings, Photos, Videos).
- **Responsive**: adapts to window size with saved/restored dimensions.
- **Grid overlay**: optional rule-of-thirds grid over the preview for composition.
- **FPS counter**: optional overlay showing current stream frame rate.
- **Keyboard navigation & accessibility**: all interactive elements have accessible labels for screen readers.

### Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Theme** | System / Light / Dark |
| **Photo directory** | System Pictures folder (XDG-compliant) |
| **Video directory** | System Videos folder (XDG-compliant) |
| **Mirror preview** | Flip the preview horizontally |
| **FPS overlay** | Show/hide framerate counter |
| **Grid overlay** | Show/hide rule-of-thirds grid |
| **Resolution** | Select from camera's available resolutions (filtered by tiers: 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K) |
| **FPS limit** | Auto, 15, 24, 30, 60 fps |
| **Capture timer** | Instant, 3s, 5s, 10s delay |
| **QR Scanner** | Enable/disable real-time QR code detection |
| **Smile Capture** | Enable/disable automatic smile-triggered photos |
| **Virtual Camera** | Start/stop v4l2loopback output |
| **Hotplug detection** | Automatically detect USB camera connect/disconnect |

### Internationalization

Fully translated into **29 languages** using GNU gettext:

Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.

All user-visible strings (labels, tooltips, dialogs, menus, accessibility text, effect names, camera control labels) are wrapped in translatable `_()` calls. The translation template (`.pot`) is automatically generated from source code with `xgettext`.

## Architecture

BigCam follows a strict separation between business logic (`core/`) and user interface (`ui/`). Core modules never import GTK/Adwaita — they communicate through GObject signals.

### Key Design Decisions

- **PipeWire-first**: V4L2 cameras are accessed through `pipewiresrc` (PipeWire node targeting) rather than `v4l2src` for better integration with the modern Linux audio/video stack.
- **OpenCV buffer probe**: All image processing (effects, zoom, pan/tilt, sharpness, backlight compensation, QR detection, smile detection) happens in a single GStreamer buffer probe. The probe converts the buffer to a NumPy array, applies processing, converts back, and replaces the buffer — all in one pass per frame.
- **Software control fallbacks**: When V4L2 controls are accepted by the kernel driver but not applied by PipeWire, software equivalents are transparently applied. The user sees the same slider; the effect just works.
- **No heavy dependencies**: The phone camera feature uses `aiohttp` (async WebSocket server) + browser's native WebRTC — no Electron, no native mobile app, no proprietary SDKs.

## Configuration

BigCam stores its configuration following the XDG Base Directory Specification:

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/bigcam/settings.json` | User preferences (theme, mirror, FPS, resolution, etc.) |
| `~/Pictures/BigCam/` | Captured photos (uses system XDG directory) |
| `~/Videos/BigCam/` | Recorded videos (uses system XDG directory) |
| `~/.cache/bigcam/` | Temporary files, self-signed TLS certificates |

Photo and video directories automatically adapt to the system language. For example, a Portuguese (Brazil) system uses `~/Imagens/BigCam/` and `~/Vídeos/BigCam/`.

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected (gPhoto2)

GVFS may be claiming the camera. BigCam handles this automatically by stopping the GVFS gphoto2 service, but if you still have issues:

```bash
systemctl --user stop gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor.service
systemctl --user mask gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor.service
pkill -9 gvfsd-gphoto2
```

### PTP Timeout (DSLR)

The camera may be in the wrong mode. Ensure it is:
- Turned **on** and connected via USB
- Set to **M** (Manual) or **P** (Program) mode
- Not in **Video** mode (some cameras lock PTP in video mode)
- Not in **sleep/auto-off** mode — set the auto-off timer to the maximum

### Virtual camera not appearing

The v4l2loopback kernel module must be loaded:

```bash
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=4 exclusive_caps=1
```

BigCam includes a configuration file at `etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf` for automatic loading on boot.

### Camera in use by another application

BigCam detects when a camera is in use (via `fuser`) and shows which process is holding it. Close the conflicting application or select a different camera.

### Phone camera: certificate warning

When scanning the QR code, your phone's browser will show a security warning because BigCam uses a self-signed certificate. This is normal and expected for LAN-only connections. Accept the warning to proceed.

### Permissions

Ensure your user is in the `video` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG video $USER
```

Log out and back in for the change to take effect.

### Translating

Translation files are in `locale/` using GNU gettext PO format. The translation template (`bigcam.pot`) contains all 304 translatable strings.

To add or update a translation:

1. Copy `locale/bigcam.pot` to `locale/<lang>.po` (e.g., `locale/de.po` for German)
2. Translate the `msgstr` entries using a PO editor (Poedit, Lokalize, or any text editor)
3. Compile with `msgfmt -o usr/share/locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/bigcam.mo locale/<lang>.po`
4. Submit a pull request

Currently supported: bg, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, fi, fr, he, hr, hu, is, it, ja, ko, nl, no, pl, pt, pt-BR, ro, ru, sk, sv, tr, uk, zh.

### Development

```bash
# Run from source (no installation needed)
cd usr/share/biglinux/bigcam
python3 main.py

# Regenerate translation template after adding new strings
find usr/share/biglinux/bigcam -name '*.py' | sort | \
  xargs xgettext --language=Python --keyword=_ --output=locale/bigcam.pot \
  --from-code=UTF-8 --package-name=bigcam

# Update all translations with new strings
for po in locale/*.po; do msgmerge --update "$po" locale/bigcam.pot; done
```
